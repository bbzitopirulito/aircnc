# aircnc
A web and mobile app using ReactJS, React Native and Node.js simulating airbnb

How to run:
 - Backend: run "yarn dev" on the backend folder (yarn dev has develop purposes only)
 - Frontend and Mobile: run "yarn start" on the frontend and mobile folders

Attention!
 - The "baseURL" value in "mobile/src/services/api.js" might change after a while. The right value will always be the one on the expo tab
 on the browser (after you run the Mobile app) above the QR code. Ignore "exp:". Just copy, for example, "192.168.0.5:" without the port.
 The right port will be the one in "backend/src/server.js" on the line that says "server.listen('port number');"
